The eventual plan for hapi is to become a complete configuration/proc mangement layer ontop of HAProxy to allow for simple progmatic configuration from a central location.

Here is the rough outline of the plan:

1. Complete support for the interface exposed via the stats socket
2. Allow for graceful restarting of the service
3. Adding/Removing configuration of backends/frontends and servers
